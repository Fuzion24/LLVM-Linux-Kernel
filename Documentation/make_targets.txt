= Make targets for vexpress =

Other build targets have similar make targets.

You can get the following with:

 make -C targets/vexpress help

targets/vexpress has these options:

* make test-boot-poweroff	- test boot clang built kernel, then power off after init runs
* make test-gcc-boot-poweroff	- test boot gcc built kernel, then power off after init runs

* make test		- simple boot to rootfs (make test-[gcc-]boot-poweroff *1)
* make test2		- bsd userspace with toybox
* make test3		- linaro/ubuntu rootfs

 Note: You currently have to do a 'killall qemu-system-arm' from another terminal
       to exit from the above tests.

* make patch-update

* make clean		- Remove most built files
* make mrproper		- Remove all downloaded and built files

* make clean-all	- clean all code
* make fetch-all	- fetch all repos and external files
* make mproper-all	- scrub all code (cleaner than clean)
* make raze-all		- Remove most things not in the llvmlinux repo
* make sync-all		- sync all repos

* make list-config	- List make variables you can specify in the CONFIG files
* make list-jobs	- List number of parallel build jobs
