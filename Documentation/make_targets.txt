= Make targets for vexpress =

Other build targets have similar make targets. You can get the following with:

 make -C targets/vexpress help

targets/vexpress has these options:

* make test-boot-poweroff	- test boot clang built kernel, then power off after init runs
* make test-gcc-boot-poweroff	- test boot gcc built kernel, then power off after init runs

* make test		- simple boot to rootfs (make test-[gcc-]boot-poweroff *1)
* make test2		- bsd userspace with toybox
* make test3		- linaro/ubuntu rootfs

 Note: You currently have to do a 'killall qemu-system-arm' from another terminal
       to exit from the above tests.

* make patch-update

* make clean		- Remove most built files
* make mrproper		- Remove all downloaded and built files

These are the generic make targets for all build targets:
* make clean-all	- clean all code
* make fetch-all	- fetch all repos and external files
* make mproper-all	- scrub all code (cleaner than clean)
* make raze-all		- Remove most things not in the llvmlinux repo
* make sync-all		- sync all repos

* make list-config	- List make variables you can specify in the CONFIG files
* make list-jobs	- List number of parallel build jobs
* make list-targets	- List all build targets
* make list-fetch-all	- List all things to be downloaded
* make list-patch-applied - List all applied patches
* make list-path	- List the search path used by the Makefiles
* make list-versions	- List the version of all relevant software

* make CONFIG=<file> ... - Choose configuration file(s) to use

These are the make targets for building LLVM and Clang:
* make llvm-[fetch,configure,build,sync,clean]
* make clang-[fetch,configure,build,sync,clean]

These are the kernel make targets:
* make kernel-[fetch,patch,configure,build,sync,clean]
* make kernel-gcc-[fetch,patch,configure,build,sync,clean]
               fetch     - clone kernel code
               patch     - patch kernel code
               configure - configure kernel code (add .config file, etc)
               build     - build kernel code
               sync      - clean, unpatch, then git pull kernel code
               clean     - clean, unpatch kernel code
* make kernel-gcc-sparse - build gcc kernel with sparse
* make kernels		- build kernel with both clang and gcc

These are the quilt (patching) make targets:
* make kernel-quilt - Setup kernel(s) to be patched by quilt
* make kernel-quilt-clean - Remove quilt setup
* make kernel-quilt-generate-series
			- Build kernel quilt series file
* make kernel-quilt-update-series-dot-target
			- Save updates from kernel quilt series file to series.target file
* make kernel-quilt-link-patches
			- Link kernel patches to target patches directory
* make list-kernel-patches
			- List which kernel patches will be applied

* make list-kernel-checkpatch [PATCH_FILTER_REGEX=<regex>]
			- List which kernel maintainers should be contacted for each patch
* make list-kernel-maintainer [PATCH_FILTER_REGEX=<regex>]
			- List which kernel maintainers should be contacted for each patch

These are the make targets for building a basic testing initramfs:
* make initramfs-[build,clean]

These are the make targets for the Linux Test Project (LTP):
* make ltp-[fetch,configure,build,sync,clean]

These are the make targets for QEMU:
* make qemu-[fetch,patch,configure,build,sync,clean]

These options are specific to building a Linux Kernel for ARM:
* make CROSS_ARM_TOOLCHAIN=[codesourcery,linaro,android] ...
			- Choose the gcc cross toolchain you want to use

These are the make targets for LTP testing vexpress:
* make test3-ltp	- linaro/ubuntu rootfs starting LTP, kernel built with clang
* make test3-gcc-ltp	- linaro/ubuntu rootfs starting LTP, kernel built with gcc
* make test3-all-ltp	- linaro/ubuntu rootfs starting LTP, for all built kernels
