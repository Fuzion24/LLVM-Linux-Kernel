= Setting up a new LLVMLinux board target =

For the following, we'll assume the new board target name is "foo".

First you need to create the board target directory, and Makefile.

 $ mkdir targets/foo
 $ cp targets/template/Makefile targets/foo

Next you need to edit the Makefile to fill in all the appropriate values.
Default values are commented out in the detault Makefile (you don't need to set
them unless they are different from the defaults. Example board build targets
are also provided.  Change the variables that need updating, and
change/update/delete make targets as appropriate.

Next you need to provide a kernel config file. Once you have a config file,
copy it to the board target directory. You can find a sample kernel config file
in targets/template/config_template.

 $ cp <kerneldir>/.config targets/foo/config_foo

Next add your new files to git:

 $ git add targets/foo

Now do a test build.

 $ cd targets/foo
 $ make

Once it's working well, commit it to git (don't forget to add a Signed-off-by
to the commit comments with "git commit -s"). From git you can then send
patches to the mailing list for inclusion in the git repo.

 $ git format-patch <commitish>
 $ git send-email --to=llvmlinux@lists.linuxfoundation.org *.patch
