= Howto not forget to sign your git commits =

Git provides you with many hooks to allow you to script various aspects of your
use of git.

If, for example, you keep on forgetting to add your Signed-off-by to your
commits (by not using "git commit -s") adding the following to your
.git/hooks/commit-msg (you may need to create the hook file, or rename the
available sample file).

 .git/hooks/commit-msg

 test 0 -lt $(grep -c '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1") || {
         echo >&2 "No Signed-off-by lines. Use 'git commit -s'"
         exit 1
 }

Once added, the above will stop a commit, if it doesn't find the
"Signed-off-by" line in your commit message.
