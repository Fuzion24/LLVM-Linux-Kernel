You can dump the current configuration file like this:

 cd targets/vexpress
 make config > config.mk

Then you can edit config.mk however you wish. You only need to include lines in
the file which differ from the defaults.

You can include any Make variable you want in the configuration file. You can
actually include make targets the same file if you found a need to.

the command line with a CONFIG= option.

 make CONFIG=config.mk kernel-build
