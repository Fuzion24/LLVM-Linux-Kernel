Choose a target in the targets directory and cd to it.
Type make, this will build the target and all the dependencies.

Valid build targets for platforms in llvm-setup and llvm-setup/targets/<targetname>:

	clang-fetch
	clang-configure
	clang-build
	clang-sync
	clang-clean

	clangdev-fetch
	clangdev-configure
	clangdev-build
	clangdev-sync
	clangdev-clean

	clang-update-all

Valid build targets for platforms in llvm-setup/targets/<targetname>:

	kernel-fetch
	kernel-configure
	kernel-build
	kernel-devbuild
	kernel-sync
	kernel-clean

Valid build targets for platforms that support testing via QEMU:

	qemu-fetch
	qemu-configure
	qemu-build

	test

The automation uses two passes to create a filter of the upstream patches
for those targets that are not synced to the tip. The filtered set of
patches are appied so it is easy to tell exactly what patches were made
and which did not apply.

The patches that do not apply are listed in the file
llvm-setup/targets/<targetname>/kernel-filter:

	F - log file used to create the following patch filter entries
	M - File is missing from the current code base
	R - Rejected hunk(s) from a patch

Patch files are also organized by common, arch specific, and platform specific.

Common patches are in common/*.patch
Arch specific patches are in common/<arch>/*.patch
Platform specific patches are in llvm-setup/targets/<targetname>/*.patch

Patches are further separated into those for unused return value warnings, general
warnings, and error fixes.
