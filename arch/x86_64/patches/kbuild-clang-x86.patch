Subject: [PATCH] x86 kbuild: LLVMLinux: More cc-options added for clang
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Protect more options for x86 with cc-option so that we don't get errors when
using clang instead of gcc.  Add more or different options when using clang as
well. Also need to enforce that SSE is off for clang and the stack is 8-byte
aligned.
