arm: LLVMLinux: Add current_stack_pointer macro for ARM

A macro to get the current stack pointer which allows for a single place in
which to do so with ASM. Before this named registers (a gcc extension) was used
to get the stack pointer. Using ASM is a more portable way of getting the stack
pointer which works with both gcc and clang.  This macro is of the same name
used in the X86 arch.
