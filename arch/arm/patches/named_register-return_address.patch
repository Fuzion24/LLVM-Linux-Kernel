Subject: [PATCH] arm: LLVMLinux: Use current_stack_pointer for return_address
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Use the global current_stack_pointer to get the value of the stack pointer.
This change supports being able to compile the kernel with both gcc and Clang.
