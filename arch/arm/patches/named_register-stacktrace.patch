arm: LLVMLinux: Use current_stack_pointer in save_stack_trace_tsk()

The existing code uses named registers to get the value of the stack pointer.
The new current_stack_pointer macro is more readable and allows for a central
portable implementation of how to get the stack pointer with ASM.  This change
supports being able to compile the kernel with both gcc and Clang.
