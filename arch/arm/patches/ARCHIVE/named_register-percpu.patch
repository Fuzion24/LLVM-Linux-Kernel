Subject: [PATCH] arm: LLVMLinux: use current_stack_pointer for percpu
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Clang requires an extra asm annotation in order to be able to use a named
register. This change supports being able to compile the kernel with both gcc
and Clang.
