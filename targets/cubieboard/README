For some reason specifying an external initrd does not work for cubieboard. 

The initrd has to be built into the kernel and a console device needs to be
created as it is not created by mdev.

The config_initrd is created with the location of the initramfs and is used
to build the kernel. The initramfs will be created automatically before the 
kernel is built.
