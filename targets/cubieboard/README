For some reason specifying an external initrd does not work for cubieboard. 

The initrd has to be built into the kernel and a console device needs to be
created as it is not created by mdev.

In order for the kernel to be built with the initramfs you have to build 
the initramfs before building the kernel.

make initramfs-build
make kernel-build
