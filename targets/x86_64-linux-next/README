CHECKPOINT/               is a folder containing known working configurations

Usage:
- cp selected CHECKPOINT to an outside directory

mkdir /tmp/checkpoint
cp CHECKPOINT/working_kernel_3.3 /tmp/checkpoint/
make CONFIG=/tmp/checkpoint/working_kernel_3.3 sync-all

- if instructed to do so on the console , checkout a specific version of llvmlinux
  Example:
  Current HEAD does not match with checkpoint /tmp/checkpoint/working_kernel_3.3. Please run:
    git checkout 2a38c62b17834671eeb1fafa7ebd76bb27bd2b86

make CONFIG=/tmp/checkpoint/working_kernel_3.3 sync-all
make CONFIG=/tmp/checkpoint/working_kernel_3.3 all

-> wait until done.
